Efavirenz is always used in combination with other HIV medicines.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEfavirenz belongs to a class (group) of HIV drugs called non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). NNRTIs attach to and block an HIV enzyme called reverse transcriptase. (An enzyme is a protein that starts or increases the speed of a chemical reaction.) By blocking reverse transcriptase, NNRTIs prevent HIV from multiplying and can reduce the amount of HIV in the body.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHIV medicines can&rsquo;t cure HIV/AIDS, but taking a combination of HIV medicines (called an HIV regimen) every day helps people with HIV live longer, healthier lives. HIV medicines also reduce the risk of HIV transmission.

Dolutegravir is always used in combination with other HIV medicines.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDolutegravir belongs to a class (group) of HIV drugs called integrase inhibitors. Integrase inhibitors block an HIV enzyme called integrase. (An enzyme is a protein that starts or increases the speed of a chemical reaction.) By blocking integrase, integrase inhibitors prevent HIV from multiplying and can reduce the amount of HIV in the body.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>HIV medicines can&rsquo;t cure HIV/AIDS, but taking a combination of HIV medicines (called an HIV regimen) every day helps people with HIV live longer, healthier lives. HIV medicines also reduce the risk of HIV transmission.</p>"},{"Question":"What should I tell my health care provider before taking dolutegravir?","Answer":"<p>Before taking dolutegravir, tell your health care provider:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>If you are allergic to dolutegravir or any other medicines. </li>\r\n    <li>If you have had or currently have liver problems, including hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. </li>\r\n    <li>If you have any other medical conditions. </li>\r\n    <li>If you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. Whether dolutegravir can harm an unborn baby is unknown. Dolutegravir should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk. Talk to your health care provider about possible risks with taking dolutegravir when pregnant.</li>\r\n    <li>If you are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. <strong>Do not breastfeed if you are infected with HIV or are taking dolutegravir.</strong></li>\r\n    <li>If you are using hormone-based birth control (such as pills, injections, or implants).&nbsp; </li>\r\n    <li><strong>About other prescription and nonprescription medicines, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take.</strong> Dolutegravir may affect the way other medicines or products work, and other medicines or products may affect how dolutegravir works. <strong>Taking dolutegravir together with certain medicines or products may cause serious side effects. Do not take dolutegravir if you take dofetilide. Taking dolutegravir and dofetilide can cause side effects that may be life threatening.</strong></li>\r\n</ul>"},{"Question":"How should I take dolutegravir?","Answer":"<p>Dolutegravir comes in tablet form. Each tablet contains 50 mg dolutegravir (brand name: Tivicay).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTake dolutegravir according to your health care provider&rsquo;s instructions.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTake dolutegravir by mouth, with or without food.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlways take dolutegravir in combination with other HIV medicines.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you take too much dolutegravir, contact your health care provider or local poison control center (1-800-222-1222) right away, or go to the nearest hospital emergency room.</p>\r\n<p>For more information on how to take dolutegravir, see the <a href=\"/drugs/509/dolutegravir/0/professional\">FDA drug label</a> from DailyMed. (DailyMed is a federal website that includes the most recent drug labels submitted to FDA.)</p>"},{"Question":"What should I do if I forget a dose?","Answer":"If you miss a dose of dolutegravir, take the missed dose as soon as you remember it. But if it is within 4 hours of your next dose, skip the missed dose and just take your next dose at the regular time. Do not take two doses at the same time to make up for a missed dose."},{"Question":"What side effects can dolutegravir cause?","Answer":"<p><strong>Dolutegravir can cause serious, life-threatening side effects.</strong> <strong>These include allergic reactions and liver problems.</strong> (See the WARNING above.)</p>\r\n<p>Other possible side effects of dolutegravir include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Changes in liver test results.

NRTIs block an HIV enzyme called reverse transcriptase. (An enzyme is a protein that starts or increases the speed of a chemical reaction.) By blocking reverse transcriptase, the two NRTIs in Combivir prevent HIV from multiplying and can reduce the amount of HIV in the body.</p>\r\n<p>HIV medicines can&rsquo;t cure HIV/AIDS, but taking a combination of HIV medicines (called an HIV regimen) every day helps people with HIV live longer, healthier lives. HIV medicines also reduce the risk of HIV transmission.&nbsp;</p>\r\nIf you are taking HIV medicines, including Combivir, don&rsquo;t cut down on, skip, or stop taking them unless your health care provider tells you to.\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"},{"Question":"What should I tell my health care provider before taking Combivir?","Answer":"<p>Before taking Combivir, tell your health care provider:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>If you are allergic to either of the medicines in Combivir (lamivudine or zidovudine) or any other medicines. </li>\r\n    <li>If you have or have ever had any blood disorders, such as anemia or bone marrow problems. </li>\r\n    <li>If you have or have ever had any muscle disorder, such as myopathy (muscle weakness). </li>\r\n    <li>If you have or have ever had kidney problems.</li>\r\n    <li>If you have or have ever had liver problems, such as HBV or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. </li>\r\n    <li>If you have any other medical conditions. </li>\r\n    <li>If you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. Whether Combivir can harm an unborn baby is unknown.&nbsp;Combivir should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Talk to your health care provider about possible risks with taking Combivir when pregnant.</li>\r\n    <li>If you are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. <strong>Do not breastfeed if you are infected with HIV or are taking Combivir.</strong> </li>\r\n    <li><strong>About other prescription and nonprescription medicines, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take.</strong> Combivir may affect the way other medicines or products work, and other medicines or products may affect how Combivir works. <strong>Taking Combivir together with certain medicines or products may cause serious/life-threatening side effects.</strong></li>\r\n</ul>"},{"Question":"How should I take Combivir?","Answer":"<p>Combivir comes in tablet form. Each tablet contains:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>150 mg lamivudine (brand name: Epivir). </li>\r\n    <li>300 mg zidovudine (brand name: Retrovir). </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Take Combivir according to your health care provider&rsquo;s instructions.</p>\r\n<p>Take Combivir with or without food.</p>\r\n<p>Always take Combivir in combination with other HIV medicines.</p>\r\n<p>If you take too much Combivir, contact your health care provider or local poison control center (1-800-222-1222) right away or go to the nearest hospital emergency room.</p>\r\n<p>For more information on how to take Combivir, see the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aidsinfo.nih.gov/drugs/285/combivir/0/professional\">FDA drug label</a> from DailyMed. (DailyMed is a federal website that includes the most recent drug labels submitted to FDA.)</p>"},{"Question":"What should I do if I forget a dose?","Answer":"<p>If you miss a dose of Combivir, take the missed dose as soon as you remember it. But if it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and just take your next dose at the regular time. Do not take two doses at the same time to make up for a missed dose.</p>"},{"Question":"What side effects can Combivir cause?","Answer":"<p>Combivir may cause side effects. Most side effects from Combivir are manageable, but a few can be serious. <strong>Serious side effects of Combivir include lactic acidosis (a buildup of lactic acid in the blood), liver problems, muscle weakness (myopathy), and blood disorders such as severe anemia (extremely reduced numbers of red blood cells) or neutropenia (reduced numbers of white blood cells).</strong> (See the WARNING above.)</p>\r\n<p>Other possible side effects of Combivir include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), a condition that sometimes occurs when the immune system begins to recover after treatment with an HIV medicine.
